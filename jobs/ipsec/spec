  # You should not have to use this in normal operation
  # It's only for situations where large IP packets are silently dropped due to encapsulation overheads
  # Specify this as a property on all DEAs, until the warden container handles PMTUD and setting MTU properly
  # Setting this to a value of the local network MTU-90 should be safe
